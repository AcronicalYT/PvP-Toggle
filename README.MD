# PvP Toggle

## Info
This plugin allows you to toggle PvP on and off. When PvP is off, players can't hurt each other. It's extremely simple and probably already exists, but I made it anyway lmao.

## Commands
- `/pvp` - Toggles PvP on and off.
- `/pvp on` - Turns PvP on.
- `/pvp off` - Turns PvP off.

## Permissions
- `pvptoggle.pvptoggle` - Allows you to use the `/pvp` command.

## Installation
1. Download the plugin from the releases page.
2. Drag the plugin into your `plugins` folder.
3. Restart your server.
4. Done!
